<h2> Hotel Taj Clone Website</h2><br>

<h5>Overview</h5><br>

<p>Welcome to the Hotel Taj Clone Website! This project is a clone of the renowned Hotel Taj website, built to showcase my skills in creating responsive and visually appealing web designs. The project was created entirely from scratch without any external help, using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.</p><br>

<h5> Features </h5><br>

<p>- **Fully Responsive Design**: The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on any device.</p><br>
<p>- **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed initially for mobile devices and then scaled up for larger screens, ensuring a consistent look and feel.</p><br>
<p>- **Advanced CSS Techniques**: Utilized CSS properties like `position` and `transparent` color to manage complex layout requirements.</p><br>

<h5> Technologies Used </h5><br>

<p>- **HTML**: For structuring the content.</p><br>
<p>- **CSS**: For styling and layout.</p><br>
<p>- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-built components.</p><br>
